We walked through the park and took in the beautiful scenery, including the lake, the Bethesda Fountain, and the Loeb Boathouse. We also stopped to play some games and have a picnic on the Great Lawn. The park was very clean and well-maintained, and the staff were friendly and helpful. We can't wait to come back and explore more of the park's many attractions!"

				"review": "I've been to Central Park many times before, but this visit was particularly special because I got to see the park in the spring. The flowers were blooming and the trees were in full bloom, making the park look even more beautiful than usual. We took a leisurely stroll around the park, stopping to admire the views and take photos. The only reason I didn't give the park 5 stars is because some of the walking paths were a bit uneven and rough. But overall, Central Park is a must-see destination in New York City!"

				"review": "I visited Central Park with my friends on a weekday afternoon and had a decent time. The park was pretty empty, which was nice because we could spread out and enjoy the scenery without feeling crowded. We walked around the park and stopped to take in the views from the Bethesda Fountain and the Loeb Boathouse. However, we were a bit disappointed that some of the park's attractions, such as the Central Park Zoo and the Conservatory Garden, were closed. Additionally, some of the walking paths were a bit dirty and littered with trash. Overall, Central Park is a nice place to visit, but it could use a bit more maintenance and upkeep."
